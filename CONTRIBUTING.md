## Project Architecture

The Extension Activity Monitor is composed of a backend responsible for the collection and storage of the activity logs (in the background page), and a frontend to allow the user to manage the log collection and view the logs (browserAction popup and an extension tab/devtools panel).

### The Extension Pages

#### Background Page

The background page acts as the backend of the extension, and the core of it is implemented in [`ext-monitor.js`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/master/src/lib/ext-monitor.js). This part is responsible for keeping track of activity logs and monitored extensions on behalf of the frontend. The background page subscribes to the `runtime.onMessage` event to listen for messages from the Popup and Activity Log pages.

#### BrowserAction Popup Page

The browserAction popup is a control panel to trigger "start monitoring" and "stop monitoring" (of extensions) and opening the Activity Log page.

#### Activity Log Page - Tab

The Activity Log page is the frontend tasked with rendering the log information from the backend. It uses the MVC architecture and [web components](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/tree/master/src/lib/web-component) for the table view and filtering options.

- The **Model** class stores activity logs being rendered in the activity log page and the data representation of the log filters. The Model class also provides the [`matchLogWithFilterObj`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/68d51940f1db397a0972658622bbdd39041436a7/src/lib/ext-activitylog.js#L43) method to check if a particular log entry does match the filters.

- The **View** class manages the [`log-view`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/master/src/lib/web-component/log-view/) and [filters web components](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/tree/master/src/lib/web-component). The log-view webcomponent is responsible for rendering the collected logs (currently in a table form) and managing the log-view context menu. The filters web components are responsible for the UI elements related to the log filters.

- The **Controller** class interacts with the backend and ensures that the Model and View are synchronized.

#### Activity Log Page - Devtools

This page can be accessed via "Extension Activity" panel in devtools. The "Extension Activity" devtools panel contains an instance of the Activity Log page where every real-time activity log collected is automatically filtered by the **current** tab id. The devtools panel retrieves the tab id filter from the devtools panel url search params, set by the devtools page by retrieving it using `browser.devtools.inspectedWindow.tabId` when the devtools panel is being registered.

### Core Features

#### Collecting Logs

The extension receives each activity log in the form of an `object` from activityLog API. The activityLog API schema can be found [here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/extensions/schemas/activity_log.json).

When the Activity Log page is opened via the popup, it fetches the existing logs (if logs were collected before) from the backend. While the Activity Log page is opened, it receives real-time logs from the backend and renders them. It can send instructions to the background page via `runtime.sendMessage` API to save logs to a JSON file, load logs from JSON file and clear logs.

- ##### Live Logging

  The backend subscribes to the `browser.activityLog.onExtensionActivity` API event to receive objects that describe the activity of the monitored extensions. While the monitor is active, any newly installed extension will be monitored automatically.

  The real-time logs are collected in the background page and sent to Activity Log page while it is opened. Activity logs are sent from the backend via the [`sendLogs`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/68d51940f1db397a0972658622bbdd39041436a7/src/lib/ext-monitor.js#L25-L33) method. The Activity Log page listens for logs via [`runtime.onMessage`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/68d51940f1db397a0972658622bbdd39041436a7/src/lib/ext-activitylog.js#L253-L265) event and render those in the [`log-view`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/master/src/lib/web-component/log-view/).

  The logs are kept in the background page unless it receives the [`clearlogs`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/68d51940f1db397a0972658622bbdd39041436a7/src/lib/ext-monitor.js#L106) instruction from Activity Log page. The background page also [sends the real-time logs](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/68d51940f1db397a0972658622bbdd39041436a7/src/lib/ext-monitor.js#L25) to Activity Log page.

- ##### Loading / saving logs

  Live logs can be saved by exporting the collected logs as JSON, via [`saveLogs`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/68d51940f1db397a0972658622bbdd39041436a7/src/lib/save-load.js#L22-L27) instruction from [`save-load.js`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/68d51940f1db397a0972658622bbdd39041436a7/src/lib/save-load.js). Previously saved logs can be loaded via loading a JSON file, which opens an instance of Activity Log page in a new tab loaded with logs from the JSON file. Note that this instance of Activity Log page doesn't receive real-time logs (as it doesn't subscribe to `browser.runtime.onMessage` event listener to receive real-time logs).

#### Rendering Logs

The logs are rendered using the [`log-view`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/master/src/lib/web-component/log-view/) web component. Any new log that doesn't match the filters will be hidden.

#### Filtering Log Entries

Individual log items can be hidden by user-defined filters. These filters are stored in the **Model** of the Activity Log page. A JSDoc explaining the filter object can be found [here](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/68d51940f1db397a0972658622bbdd39041436a7/src/lib/ext-activitylog.js#L21-L38). The **Model** is updated when the controller is notified of filter changes via [`onFilterChanged`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/68d51940f1db397a0972658622bbdd39041436a7/src/lib/ext-activitylog.js#L338-L347). Ultimately, the [`log-view` hides](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/68d51940f1db397a0972658622bbdd39041436a7/src/lib/web-component/log-view/log-view-element.js#L28-L34) the table rows that didn't match the applied filters. The filters can be changed by the user via the following UI components:

- [`filter-option`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/tree/master/src/lib/web-component/filter-option) provides the UI to filter by individual properties of log entries (such as extension id, view type, API name, API type). The available filter values are derived from the logs collected so far. During live logging, new unknown filter values may appear and be appended to the filter UI.
- [`filter-keyword`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/tree/master/src/lib/web-component/filter-keyword) provides the UI to filter by substring. It searches the provided substring inside the `data` property of the log object.
- [`filter-timestamp`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/tree/master/src/lib/web-component/filter-timestamp) provides the UI to filter by timestamps. The timestamps filter can be applied by choosing "start time" or "stop time" or both (from the context menu) to hide the logs that don't fall under the chosen timestamp range.

When the Activity Log page is opened through the devtools panel, logs will be filtered by that tab's id. This filter cannot be changed through the UI.
